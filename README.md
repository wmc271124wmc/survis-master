[![Status: Coursework Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Coursework_Complete-green.svg)]()

This repository hosts an interactive visualization of a literature review focused on **Multi-Agent Large Language Model (LLM) Systems**. Developed as part of the COMP4126 Research Methods coursework, this project leverages [SurVis](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis), a visual literature browser framework, to provide an engaging way to explore key research in this domain.

## 📚 Literature Categorization

The selected papers are organized into four primary categories based on the nature of LLM agent interactions:

### 1. Self-Improvement Methods
_Papers focusing on agents learning and refining their approaches from their own experiences or internal reflections._
* *Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning*
* *Improving Language Model Negotiation with Self-Play and In-Context Learning from AI Feedback*
* *Unleashing Cognitive Synergy through Multi-Persona Self-Collaboration*

### 2. Debate-Based Methods
_Papers employing structured argumentation and discussion between multiple agents to achieve outcomes._
* *Improving Factuality and Reasoning through Multiagent Debate*
* *Encouraging Divergent Thinking through Multi-Agent Debate*
* *ChatEval: Towards Better LLM-Based Evaluators Through Multi-Agent Debate*

### 3. Role-Based Collaboration Frameworks
_Papers that establish structured workflows where agents assume specialized roles to collaborate on tasks._
* *CAMEL: Communicative Agents for Mind Exploration*
* *MetaGPT: Meta Programming for Multi-Agent Collaboration*
* *Multi-Agent Collaboration: Harnessing Intelligent LLM Agents*

### 4. Game-Theoretic Approaches
_Papers applying principles of multi-agent interaction within game scenarios or game-like environments._
* *Exploring LLMs for Communication Games: An Empirical Study on Werewolf*

### Cross-cutting Dimensions
Beyond these categories, the literature is also analyzed across several key dimensions:
* **Application Domains:** Including code generation, reasoning, negotiation, and evaluation.
* **Memory Integration Approaches:** Such as external memory, in-context experience, or no explicit memory.

## 🚀 How to Use the Visualization

The interactive SurVis interface allows you to:

1.  **Filter:** Use the tag selectors at the top of the page to narrow down papers by categories, application domains, or memory integration approaches.
2.  **Search:** Employ the search box to locate papers by author, title, or specific keywords.
3.  **Explore Visualization Modes:** Switch between different views (if your SurVis setup offers them) to understand relationships and patterns within the literature.
4.  **View Details:** Click on any paper entry to expand its full abstract and other relevant details.

## 🛠️ Technical Information

* This visualization is built using [SurVis](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis), a framework by Beck et al., designed for creating visual literature browsers.
* The core literature data is stored in BibTeX format (`.bib`) and has been converted to JSON (`.json`) to power the interactive features.

## 🔎 Paper Selection Methodology

The 10 papers featured in this review were chosen through a systematic search process. The focus was on influential research in multi-agent LLM systems, primarily published in 2023. These works were selected to represent key developments and diverse methodological approaches shaping the field.

## 🎓 About the Coursework

This interactive visualization is a key component of a comprehensive literature review on multi-agent LLM systems, submitted for the COMP4126 Research Methods course. The full review also includes:

* An analysis of current challenges and open questions in the research field.
* A clearly defined scope for the literature survey.
* Detailed summaries of each selected paper, organized by the categories outlined above.
* An in-depth discussion of emerging research trends and potential future directions.
